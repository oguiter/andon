# Andon IoT Light Notification System

This project is based on the [ANAVI Light Controller](https://github.com/AnaviTechnology/anavi-docs/blob/master/anavi-light-controller/anavi-light-controller.md#anavi-light-controller) by Leon Anavi.

“Andon” is a japanese term used in manufacturing referring to a system designed to alert operators and managers of problems in real time. Pioneered by Toyota after WW2, it gives the operators the ability to stop the production line as soon as an error is detected.

This project is led by [wing.eu](https://wing.eu) employees in France.
